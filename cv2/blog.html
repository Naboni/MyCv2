                <p class="title"> Relative Size (%,em,rem) </p>
                <article>
                    <p>Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ?</p>
                    <p>No, it doesn't matter. I say this beacause all relative size measurements are applicable in their own ways. But There doesn’t seem to be an industry standard way of handling responsive typography yet, with some preferring to use em, some rem, and others a combination of the two. 
                        There’s even a growing group that say to never use px for font-sizes because it doesn’t allow the user to increase or decrease font-size in their browser settings. To be honest, there’s valid arguments from all sides, so it’s best to use the method that makes sense for the 
                        project you’re working on and the audience that it’s for. One thing is for sure, setting a px root font-size, and then using rem to scale your type up or down from there is super easy to grasp, scale, and maintain. Hopefully it will be of help to you too.</p>
                    <p>Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>em is Relative to the font-size of the element </li>
                            <li>rem is Relative to font-size of the root element</li>
                            <li>% is Relative to the parent element.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <p class="title"> Browser Width</p>
                <article>
                    <p>We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ?</p>
                    <p>16px is default browser width meaning that it is 100%. So, If 16 px is 100%, 200px is 1,250%. In this case if I set 14px for a font-size in my body. And then I change my font size in div to 1250% it is going to be displayed 200px on my browser.</p>

                <p class="title"> Specific Changes in CSS3 </p>
                <article>
                    <p>The latest version of Cascade Style Sheets, CSS 3, was developed to make Web design easier. The major changes in CSS3 are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS3 Selectors <br> <ul>
                            <li>In addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So you don't need to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style them.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>CSS3 Rounded Corners <br> <ul>
                            <li>Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in content can break them.
                                <br>
                                CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing the border-radius property, which gives you the same rounded-corner effect and you don't have to write all the code. Here are examples for displaying rounded corners in different places of a website.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>CSS3 Border Image <br> <ul>
                            <li>Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>CSS3 Box Shadow <br> <ul>
                            <li>A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS code.
                                <br>
                                After previously removing this property from the CSS 3 Backgrounds and Borders Module, the W3C added it back in the last working draft</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>CSS3 Text Shadow <br> <ul>
                            <li>The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it. A similar property called box-shadow is also available in CSS 3.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        
                        
                    </ul>
